\section{Conclusion}
This paper studies the container placement strategy in a heterogeneous cluster.
We target on distributing containers to the worker nodes with the best available resources.
In this paper, we develop \sol, which considers various resource demands from containers and 
current available resources on each node. We implemented \sol~on Docker Swarmkit platform and 
conducted extensive experiments. 
The results show a significant improvement on the 
system stability and scalability when comparing with the default Spread strategy.
